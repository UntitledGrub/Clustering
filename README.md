# Clustering
An implentation of the K-means++ and K-medians clustering algorithms

## Objective
Cluster objects in the dataset into k many clusters, where each cluster has a represenative around whihc it is centered. K-means++ and K-medians aim to iteratively
minimise the sum of distances between objects in the dataset and the represenative of the cluster they are assigned to.

## Implementation

## Results


## Dataset
The dataset consists of words paired with a vector of numerical values is small scale and have been uploaded to this repository.
