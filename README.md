# Clustering
An implentation of the K-means++ and K-medians clustering algorithms

## Objective
The aim  is to cluster objects in the dataset into k many clusters, where each cluster has a represenative around whihc it is centered. K-means++ and K-medians iteratively minimise the sum of distances between objects in the dataset and the represenative of the cluster they are assigned to.



## Implementation
### Initial representative selection: the ++ in k-means++
